# hello-world
My first respository on github. I've known about this place for awhile but I haven't done anything about it until now. Hopefully, I can get used to this and start uploading projects here.

I really am a web developer and it has taken me awhile to get here. I used my vacation time from another job just take a small internship at a media company. To get the job that I have now, I interviewed for it back in Spring 2015. By September of that year, I found out I didn't get it. But because I made such a good impression on them and stayed positive, they REMEMBERED over a year later in October of 2016 and offered me my first web dev job!
